متوالی به صورت جداگانه بر روی بخش های مختلف سیستم های خود کار می کردند، همانطور که گفته شد ROG به صورت تخصصی بر روی قطعاتی همچون مادربرد، کارت گرافیک و لوازم جانبی از جمله کیس گیمینگ کار و Strix به صورت تخصصی بر روی فن ها و سیستم خنک کننده محصولات کار می کرد، این دو برند پس از مدت کوتاهی باهم ترکیب و به صورت تیمی بر روی محصولات کار خود را شروع کردند.\r\n                <br />\r\n                در ادامه شما را با محصولات و انواع مختلف محصولات تولیدی این برند آشنا خواهیم کرد.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: '18px', marginTop: 15

fontSize: '18px', marginTop: 15 }}>سخت افزار در دسکتاپ های ROG STRIX:</h2>\r\n                <br />\r\n                شرکت ایسوس در انتخاب پردازنده های کامپیوترهای Strix  Rog خود خیلی سخت گیرانه عمل می کند تا بتواند بهترین پردازنده ها را انتخاب و آن ها را تا 14 درصد اورکلاک کند تا از پردازنده های دیگر موجود در بازار قوی تر باشند به این ترتیب هر زمان که اراده کنید می توانید به آسانی و با استفاده از Turbo Gear فرکانس پردازنده را از 4 گیگاهرتز به 4.6 گیگاهرتز ارتقا دهید. نیازی به راه اندازی مجدد کامپیوترتان نخواهید داشت و بسیار راحت می توانید پس از اورکلاک، استفاده از کامپیوتر خود را ادامه دهید. خنک کننده های آبی بر روی پردازنده باعث می شوند تا خیالتان از نظر پایداری سیستم خود حین اورکلاک راحت باشد.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: '18px', marginTop: 15 }}>جلوه های ویژه</h2>\r\n                <br />\r\n                کامپیوترهای Rog Strix از دو مدل کارت گرافیکی که با یکدیگر SLI شده اند استفاده می کنند. این دو غول گرافیکی در کنار یکدیگر می توانند جلوه های جذابی را در حین بازی برای شما به ارمغان اورد، به این ترتیب شما می توانید از جلوه های ویژه و جذابی در حین بازی بهرمند شوید، به گونه ای که دیگر هیچ لگ و پرشی در

<br />\r\n                قطعاتی همچون هارد، مادربرد <a href=\"https://rogstrix.com/Subproduct/179\"> (CPU)سی پی یو </a>و غیره با نام مهمترین قطعات یک سیستم گیمینگ قدرتمند شناخته می شوند. شما باید بتوانید تعادلی میان قیمت و عملکرد قطعات اصلی کامپیوتر خود برقرار کنید. در حالت ایده ‌آل، کیس گیمینگ باید یکی از عالی ترین کارت‌های گرافیک و سی پی یوهای موجود در بازار را برای اجرای با کیفیت بازی‌ها داشته باشد.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: '18px', marginTop: 15 }}>کارت گرافیک  ROG STRIX </h2>\r\n                <br />\r\n                برای گیمرها و کسانی که از کامپیوتر شخصی برای کار های گرافیکی استفاده میکنند ‌کارت گرافیک بیشترین اهمیت را در میان دیگر قطعات دارد. <a href=\"https://rogstrix.com/Subproduct/182\"> کارت گرافیک </a>قطعه‌ای است که زیبایی‌های بصری بازی‌ را به شما نشان می‌دهد. هر چه کارت حجم بالاتری داشته باشد معمولاً عملکرد بهتری دارد . شما میتوانید در فروشگاه ما تمامی گرافیک های تولید شده توسط ASUS  یا بقیه برند ها را خریداری کنید.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: '18px', marginTop: 15 }}>مادربرد ROG STRIX</h2>\r\n                <br />\r\n                مادربرد یکی دیگر از قطعات مهم است  که همۀ اجزای سازندۀ رایانه شما را به هم متصل می کند و امکان برقراری ارتباط میان تمام سخت ‌افزارهای مختلف را فراهم می‌کند. نوع مادربرد مورد نظر شما تا حد زیادی به پردازنده‌ آن بستگی دارد. ویژگی‌هایی همچون قابلیت اورکلاک CPU و نورپردازی، فاکتورهایی اند که باید هنگام خریدن مادربرد rog در نظر داشته باشید.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: '18px', marginTop: 15 }}>پاور ROG STRIX</h2>\r\n                <br />\r\n                هیچوقت یک پاور یا PSU ضعیف نخرید، زیرا یک پاور ارزان به زودی خراب می شود و به سایر قطعات نیز آسیب می‌زند. همیشه پاوری را در نظر بگیرید که از میزان وات سیستم گیمینگ شما ظرفیت بالاتری داشته باشد و بعد از انتخاب آن، گواهینامه 80Plus بگیرید.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"18px\", marginTop: 15 }}>لوازم جانبی ROG STRIX</h2>\r\n                <br />\r\n                اگر گیمر حرفه‌‌ ای می باشید و یا فقط برای خودتان بازی می‌کنید، شما نمی‌توانید بر روی یک صندلی معمولی بشینید و یا تجهیزات خودتان را بر روی یک میز نامناسبی بگذارید موس، کیبورد و یا دسته بازی بی کیفیت شما را به مرور خسته می‌کند. به همین دلیل باید لوازم جانبی مناسبی را تهیه کنید.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>صندلی گیمینگ</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                شاید صندلی از آخرین مواردی باشد که به آن توجه می‌کنید، اما اگر ساعت ‌های طولانی صرف بازی می‌کنید، در فکر تهیه کردن آن باشید. طراحی ارگونومی  صندلی های گیمینگ وضعیت بدن شما را بهبود می بخشد.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>اسپیکر گیمینگ</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                اغلب  جلوه‌های بصری بازی روی مانیتور، بر صدا اولویت دارند. با این حال، هر چه اسپیکر با کیفیت‌تر باشد، صدای واقعی‌تر و تجربه لذت‌بخش‌تری خواهید داشت. اسپیکر های STRIX  ROG  با کیفیت بالای خود این حس واقعی را به شما منتقل می کند.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: 8, marginTop: 15 }}>هدست گیمینگ:</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                وقتی صحبت از بازی ‌های FPS  و یا اکشن می‌شود، داشتن صدایی دقیق و شفاف برای عملکرد شما ضروری است. در این صورت، هدست با کیفیت بالا برای برقراری ارتباط موثر و واضح در مسابقات رقابتی خواهد بود.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>مودم گیمینگ:</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                اگر بازی‌های آنلاین زیادی انجام می‌دهید نیاز به اینترنت دارید. بنابراین خرید مودم گیمینگ با کیفیت از ضروریات کار شماست. یک مودم بی‌کیفیت، بازی شما را مکرر با تاخیر مواجه می‌کند، زیرا یک مودم بی‌کیفیت نمی‌تواند سیگنال‌ها را به سرعت ترجمه کند تا به دستگاهی که با آن بازی می‌کنید ارسال کند. در هنگام خرید مودم باید به دو نکته توجه کنید:\r\n                *•\tحداکثر سرعت مودم\r\n                *•\tتعداد کانال‌های مودم\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>دسته بازی:</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                یک دسته گیمینگ از طریق USB یا به صورت بلوتوث بازی شما را به سطح بالایی ارتقا می‌دهد. یک دسته گیمینگ عالی مجهز به دکمه‌های چند منظوره و با طراحی ارگونومیک و وزن مناسب، محبوبیت زیادی در بین گیمرها خواهد داشت. همچنین دسته بازی با نمایشگرهای بازخورد لرزشی دوگانه به شما امکان می‌دهد بازی را به معنای واقعی کلمه در دستان خود احساس کنید. علاوه بر این، اتصال بی‌سیم دسته بازی به شما امکان می‌دهد سیم‌ها را به طور کامل قطع کنید تا بتوانید با حداکثر راحتی بازی کنید.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>کیبورد گیمینگ</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                کیبورد گیمینگ برای پیروزی در بازی‌ها نقشی اساسی دارد. کیبوردهای گیمینگ به دلیل ویژگی‌های بازی محور و زیبایی شان در میان گیمرها بیشتر جلب توجه می کنند. همچنین تعدادی از کیبوردهای ارگونومیک با ظاهری زیبا و شگفت‌انگیز برای راحتی، سهولت و همچنین داشتن کارایی بالا طراحی شده‌اند.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>موس گیمینگ</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                معمولا انتخاب موس‌های گیمینگ بستگی به ژانر بازی دارند زیرا هر مدل برای برخی از بازی‌ها کاربرد بیشتری دارد. در بازی‌های MMO و MOBA، گیمر های حرفه‌ای‌ها معمولا از  موسی که ماکروهای اضافی دارد را برای سهولت و کارایی بیشتر استفاده می کنند. برای مثال مدل‌هایی مانند Corsair Scimitar و Razer Naga Hex به همین دلیل محبوب هستند.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>فرمان بازی</h3>\r\n\r\n                <br />\r\n                بازی با فرمان گیمینگ با  دامنه حرکتی بهتر و دقیق‌تری که دارد باعث می شود در بازی غرق شوید و  بازی واقعی تر و به بازی ‌ نزدیک‌تر می‌شوید. با استفاده از فرمان گیمینگ ، بازیکنان کنترل بیشتری بر بازی دارند. بازی از طریق فرمان بازی به شما امکان می‌دهد به طور مستقیم‌  و سریع واکنش نشان دهید و بسیار کمتر از یک دسته بازی، حواس‌تان پرت شود.\r\n                وب کم گیمینگ:\r\n                حالات چهره، زبان بدن و احساسات شما برای اینکه بیننده از گیم استریم لذت ببرد، مهم هستند بنابراین وب کم مهم است زیرا به بینندگان گیم استریم اجازه می‌دهد شما را ببینند. پس برای گیم استریم نیاز به یک وب‌کم گیمینگ مناسب دارید تا بتوانید با کیفیت بسیار بالا چهره شما را به بینندگان نشان دهد. برای این کار حتما نیاز نیست وب کم گران قیمت بخرید، دستگاهی که بتواند با کیفیت 1080p  تصاویر را ضبط کند برای شما مناسب است.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 style={{ fontFamily: 'IRANSans-Bold', fontSize: \"16px\", marginTop: 15 }}>مولتی

کرد، این دو برند پس از مدت کوتاهی باهم ترکیب و به صورت تیمی بر روی محصولات کار خود را شروع کردند.\r\n                <br />\r\n                در ادامه شما را با محصولات و انواع مختلف محصولات تولیدی
